Fetch Inventory:

1. Date Range should be required query parameters as how to fetch the result sample would be really confusing/tricky if dates aren't there.

	If above params are required then we do below things:
	1. Hotel id and Room id missing? 
	 - Fetch all the available rooms for all the hotels for the chosen date range.
	2. Hotel id missing?
	 - Fetch all the hotels with roomid, if room with id is available for the hotel for the chosen 	   dates.
	3. Room id missing?
	 - Fetch all the hotels with all their rooms, if rooms are available for the hotel with hotelID for 	 	   the chosen dates.
API call should show appropriate error message if dates aren't chosen.

2. We should only be showing the rooms in response if they are available, if remainingRoom is 0 then we shouldn't really be showing that in response as this API's purpose is to fetch available rooms from selected hotels and selected dates , if rooms are not there then there is no sense in showing them in reponse with remainingRoom as 0.


Update Inventory:

1. POST call should be only for inserting purpose and we should have PUT call for updating purpose.
2. hotel_id, rooom_id should also be required parameter in request body along with data.
3. start_date & end_date should be required on conditional basis
	- They are not needed if hotel/roomID entry exists in rate and remaining room table.
